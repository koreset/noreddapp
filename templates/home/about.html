        <h1>We are NRAN!</h1>
        <p><strong>No REDD in Africa Network (NRAN)</strong> is a collective of African civil society and community-based organizations and individuals opposed to all forms of REDD and REDD-Type projects. NRAN sees REDD as a false climate solution that merely permits polluters to pollute and further harm the climate. We work to defend forest-dependent communities while promoting community-based forest protection. NRAN works with similar networks and groups in other regions of the world.</p>
        <h3>What's REDD anyway?</h3>
        <p>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) gains prominence as a false climate solution and is positioned an escape valve for polluters who delight in a climate regime that has shifted from legally binding requirements to voluntary, nationally determined commitments to emissions reduction.</p>
        <p>The REDD mechanism is already resulting in the violation of individual rights, as well as collective rights of communities and indigenous peoples. REDD offers polluting industries, carbon speculators, and governments that serve them the freedom to continue officially endorsed misbehaviour. </p>
        <p>No REDD in Africa Network (NRAN) opposes REDD-type projects, and all their variants, and shows them for what they are: unjust mechanisms designed to usher in a new phase of colonization of the African continent. </p>
        <p>REDD and REDD-type projects portend not just land or water grabs but a continental grab. This not just another scramble for Africa, but a vicious grabbing of the entire continent, with those selling out demanding to be applauded for doing so in the name of “sustainable development”. REDD is on course to result in grossly oppressive and exploitative systemic and structural changes which include a historic takeover of land tenure and water tenure, carbon colonialism, carbon slavery and exacerbated forms of violence against women. REDD constitutes a new offensive against the peoples of Africa, especially farmers, pastoralists, hunter-gatherers and indigenous peoples. </p>
        <p>The No REDD in Africa Network warns that REDD may also be the ultimate wedge to crack open the door for the invasion of the African continent with genetically modified crops and trees. It could also promote the false notion that genetically modified crops are “climate smart” agriculture. It threatens to take over soils, water (blue carbon) and entire eco-systems. It may also rekindle the culture of colonial plantation agriculture which places emphasis on agriculture for export rather than for food.</p>
